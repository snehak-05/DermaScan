RECOMMENDED SKINCARE:
-----------------------------------
- Your skin appears oily, which means your pores may produce excess sebum throughout the day. Use a gentle gel-based facewash twice daily to remove oil without damaging your skin barrier. Incorporate salicylic acid (1–2%) three to four times a week to control oil and prevent clogged pores. Choose oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizers with niacinamide or hyaluronic acid to maintain balance. Avoid heavy creams or thick sunscreens and switch to a lightweight gel-based SPF 50. Using a clay mask twice a week can help clear deep impurities. Try not to overwash your face as it increases oil production, and use blotting sheets to control shine during the day.
- Your skin shows signs of dryness, which means your moisture barrier may need extra support. Use a hydrating, cream-based non-foaming cleanser to maintain hydration. Apply a thick moisturizer with ceramides, squalane, glycerin, or shea butter twice daily. Use a hydrating serum with hyaluronic acid on damp skin to improve moisture retention. Avoid using hot water on your face since it increases dryness and weakens the barrier. Daily sunscreen is essential because dry skin develops fine lines faster. Stay away from harsh scrubs and alcohol-based toners, and consider using an overnight sleeping mask to repair the skin barrier.
- Your skin shows signs of clogged pores, whiteheads, or blackheads, which means your skin needs consistent exfoliation. Salicylic acid (BHA) is highly effective as it cleans deep inside the pores, so include it regularly in your routine. Use a clay mask twice a week to absorb oil and draw out impurities. Niacinamide serum can also help reduce oiliness and make pores appear smaller. Avoid using harsh physical scrubs, and instead exfoliate gently once or twice a week. Use lightweight, non-comedogenic products to avoid further pore congestion. Retinol at night can also prevent whiteheads and improve skin turnover.
